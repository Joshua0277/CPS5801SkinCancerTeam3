# Skin Cancer Classification (Malignant vs. Benign)

This project develops a deep learning model to classify skin lesions as malignant or benign using the Kaggle dataset: [Skin Cancer: Malignant vs Benign](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fanconic/skin-cancer-malignant-vs-benign).

## Features

- Preprocessing with resizing, normalization, and augmentation (flip, rotation, zoom, brightness)
- Model: Fine-tuned ResNet18 with transfer learning
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUC
- Early stopping and best model checkpointing
- Final performance validated on test set
